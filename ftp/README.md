# program5

An ftp client written in C for sending files from a client to a server.

## Features

1. retrieves files requested from the server

2. shows files available to retrieve from the server with `index` 
	* this is sort of like `ls` (wherever the server is running)
	* this can actually be an easier starting goal

3. append to a log file all the transactions done between the server and the client
