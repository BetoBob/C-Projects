# mytar

An implementation of the `tar` archiving tool. This program is capable of:

1. creating `tar` files (`create.c`)
2. extracting `tar` files (`extract.c`)
3. providing information about a tar file; i.e. the files and directories of the `tar` package and their associated permissions (`table.c`)

A significant portion of this project deals with C memory management and understanding system files.
